# Multi-modal-clickbait-classifier
 a multimodal deep learning model that anticipates the clickbait nature through the text and images uploaded on social media, this study seeks to recognize social media posts in a heuristic manner

we proposed a Multimodal model for click-
bait detection on social media platforms that predicts both
the images and text data posted. Considering the different
configurations of word embeddings and classifier models of
the whole dataset, Bi-GRU models trained with Word2Vec
embedding outperformed all the other models in the classi-
fication of text and performs better than traditional machine
learning algorithms in clickbait-detection tasks. The 2-layer
CNN model outperforms the VGG Network for the given
dataset provided. The multimodal model generated from the
best-performing classifiers classifies the social media post in
an efficient manner.
